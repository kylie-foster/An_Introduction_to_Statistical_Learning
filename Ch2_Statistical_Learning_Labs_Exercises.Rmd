## 2.3.2 Graphics

An alternative to the suggested `plot` is to use `ggplot`. `ggplot` is useful for more complicated plots. 

```{r plot}
x = rnorm(100) # setting x to a vector of 100 random numbers with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
y = rnorm(100)

# Using plot to plot a scatterplot:
plot(x, y)
plot(x, y, xlab = "this is the x-axis", ylab = "this is the y-axis",
     main = "Plot of X vs Y")

# Alternatively, using ggplot to plot a scatterplot
# Need to make a data frame or tibble for the data we want to plot with ggplot:
data = tibble(y,x)

ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(xlab = "this is the x-axis", ylab = "this is the y-axis",
       title = "ggplot2 Plot of X vs Y")

```

It is easy to save plots created using `ggplot` as many different file types.

```{r plot_save}
x = rnorm(100) # setting x to a vector of 100 random numbers with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
y = rnorm(100)
# Need to make a data frame or tibble for the data we want to plot with ggplot:
data = tibble(y,x)

# Saving plot as pdf:
pdf ("Figure.pdf")
plot(x,y,col = "green")
dev.off ()

# Alternatively, saving ggplot using ggsave
a <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(color = "green") +
  labs(xlab = "this is the x-axis", ylab = "this is the y-axis",
       title = "ggplot2 Plot of X vs Y")
ggsave("Figure_ggplot.pdf", a)

```

## 2.3.4 Loading Data

Here are some alternatives to `read.table()`:

```{r load}
# Importing .data file:
Auto <- read.table ("Auto.data", header = T, na.strings = "?")
fix(Auto)

read_delim("Auto.data", delim = "
           ") #seems more complicated than read.table

# Importing .csv file:
Auto <- read.csv("Auto.csv", header =T,na.strings ="?") # Auto is a data frame

Auto_2 <- read_csv("Auto.csv") # Auto_2 is a tibble. Don't need to specify that there is a header, missing values ("?") are imported as NA automatically


```
