## tree()

`tree(formula, data, weights, subset,
     na.action = na.pass, control = tree.control(nobs, ...),
     method = "recursive.partition",
     split = c("deviance", "gini"),
     model = FALSE, x = FALSE, y = TRUE, wts = TRUE, ...)`
     

A tree is grown by binary recursive partitioning using the response (Y) in the specified formula and choosing splits from the terms of the right-hand-side (the predictors).

### Inputs

- `formula`: A formula expression. The left-hand-side (response) can be either a *numerical* vector (for a regression tree) or a *factor* (for a classification tree). The syntax is similar to `lm()`, so the right-hand-side should be a series of numeric or factor variables separated by `+`, both `.` and `-` are allowed. But interaction terms are not allowed.
